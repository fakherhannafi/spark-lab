# spark-lab

This project aims to ingest and clean airbnb public data via AWS Glue. 

# Glue Configurations
You can access to aws console to create a new glue job or deploy via an IaC tool like Cloudformation or Terraform...

I created a service role which is able to access to s3 bucket and Cloudwatch Log in Read and Write Mode.
I have allocated 2 workers for my glue job. I am using Glue 3.0
